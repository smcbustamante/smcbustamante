# 💫 About Me:
Sharina May C. Bustamante<br>Aspiring Digital Marketer<br>"Creating experiences that inspire."<br><br>ABOUT ME<br>I am a 19-year-old sophomore student pursuing a BS in Marketing. I was born in Cebu City on May 9, 2006, and later moved with my parents to Davao City. I come from a family of four: my parents, my younger sister, and me. I  am interested in design, especially character design. This led me to draw many characters, including the mascot, in my profile. I like to draw, sing, read webcomics, and watch animated shows.<br><br>SKILLS<br>- Drawing<br>- Group collaboration<br>- Time management<br>- Digital communication<br>- Adaptability and resilience<br><br>CONTACT LINK<br>Email: smcbustamante@addu.edu.ph
